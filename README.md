## Sheepy Time (Solo Mode)

Sheepy Time is an engaging board game where you play as a dream sheep tasked with protecting the dreamer's slumber from nightmares. In the solo mode, your objective is to navigate through the dreamer's cycles of sleep, managing both your movements and the nightmare's advances to keep the dreamer asleep.

Your goal is to gather enough winks (points) to win before the dreamer is awakened by nightmares. Each round represents a sleep cycle, and you must strategically use your sheep's abilities to move through the dream track, avoiding or confronting nightmares that try to wake the dreamer.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Nightmare's Movement

Determined by a deck of cards that dictate its actions each turn, influencing how you navigate the dream track.

### Zzzs and Winks

Collect Zzzs to gain special abilities and earn Winks to move towards victory. Managing these resources is key to success in solo play.

## Strategy

Solo mode challenges you to think ahead, anticipate the nightmare's moves, and use your limited actions efficiently. Each decision affects the dreamer's state and your ability to collect Winks.
